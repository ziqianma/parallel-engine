# Parallel Engine

This is a 3D game engine written with C++ using OpenGL 4.3+.<br />
I am using this as a space to implement graphics features I've learned in the context of a game engine!<br />
The repo contains two parts: A "𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞" Library and an "𝐀𝐩𝐩" application.<br />
The core library is compiled statically and built to be reused for any application project, and future OpenGL-based game projects.<br />
The app part will contain test implementations of the engine (to show off the capability of features)<br />

## Included
Some features that have been or will be implemented within the engine are:<br />
- Windowing, Game State Management, 3D projection rendering setup w/ Camera
- Graph-style renderer implementation
- Model/material loading, primitive meshes (cube, sphere, plane)
- Procedural terrain system
- Lighting and Raytracing
- And more!
